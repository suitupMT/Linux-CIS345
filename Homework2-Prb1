Task: Write a bash script called greeting that will print out "Good morning username " in the morning,
"Good morning username between 12: 00 and 5:59 and "Good evening username " after 6:00. Substitute the
user's real first name for username. The first letter of the user's name should be capitalized. Then it should 
report the user's last time of login and some statistics about your system. Report a total of how many users are 
logged in then display the user name, real name, and login time in columns with each listed only once.
